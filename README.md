# Network_Security_project
AI and Intrusion Detection
The topic of this project is AI (Artificial Intelligence) and intrusion detection with a focus on machine learning approaches. The use case is related to IoT (Internet of Things), where network traffic attacks were simulated on a real network. Using Wireshark, the data were filtered and structured in the form of a dataset (https://perso.esiee.fr/~omarm/datasets/Partial-IDS-IoT-Dataset.csv).


The Jupyter notebook provided in this work should be run in an environment that has all the necessary packages.

All the necessary packages are listed in the `esiee_reqs.txt` file.
Anaconda environment for this notebook can be created by executing the following commands in the terminal:

**conda create -n esiee --file esiee_reqs.txt**

**conda activate esiee**
