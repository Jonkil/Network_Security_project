AI and Intrusion Detection
The topic of this project is AI (Artificial Intelligence) and intrusion detection with a focus on machine learning approaches. The use case is related to IoT (Internet of Things), where network traffic attacks were simulated on a real network. Using Wireshark, the data were filtered and structured in the form of a dataset (https://perso.esiee.fr/~omarm/datasets/Partial-IDS-IoT-Dataset.csv).
